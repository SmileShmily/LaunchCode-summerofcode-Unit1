Chapter 5 Assignment
FILE(s): chapter5_assignment.py

Write a function called areaOfCircle, which takes the radius as an argument, and returns the area of the circle with that radius.

As a refresher, the area of any circle is equal to the radius squared, multiplied by pi (where pi is 3.14159....).

Donâ€™t forget to include the math module, where pi is defined.

*NOTE -- in the book, you are given some test cases below your function. Do not include those here in Vocareum.
Just add your function to the chapter5_assignment.py file.
