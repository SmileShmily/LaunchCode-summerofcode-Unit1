'''The goal of this studio is to find the top 20 words in Shakespeare’s play Coriolanus.
The get_text function is written for you - it loads the text of the entire play into a big string.
Your job is to write the main function. You’ll probably want to keep track of words with a dictionary.

This code will not work inside the book, so you will need to run it locally on your computer.
Create a new directory called studio12/, and within that, create a new file called coriolanus.py and open it on Atom (or another text editor):

$ mkdir studio12
$ cd studio12
$ atom coriolanus.py

Then, copy and paste the starter-code below into your python file.

If you run your file...

$ python3 coriolanus.py

...you should see the entire play printed out on your console.
