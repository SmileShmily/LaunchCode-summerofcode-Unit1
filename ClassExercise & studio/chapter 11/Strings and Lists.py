'''Two of the most useful methods on strings involve lists of strings.
The split method breaks a string into a list of words.
By default, any number of whitespace characters is considered a word boundary.
'''
song = "The rain in Spain..."
wds = song.split()
print(wds)


'''An optional argument called a delimiter can be used to specify which characters to use as word boundaries.
 The following example uses the string ai as the delimiter:
'''

song = "The rain in Spain..."
wds = song.split('ai')
print(wds)

'''Notice that the delimiter doesnâ€™t appear in the result.

The inverse of the split method is join. You choose a desired separator string,
(often called the glue) and join the list with the glue between each of the elements.
'''

wds = ["red", "blue", "green"]
glue = ';'
s = glue.join(wds)
print(s)
print(wds)

print("***".join(wds))
print("".join(wds))


'''The list that you glue together (wds in this example) is not modified.
Also, you can use empty glue or multi-character strings as glue.
'''

myname = "Edgar Allan Poe"
namelist = myname.split()
init = ""
for aname in namelist:
    init = init + aname[0]
print(init)
'''Correct! Yes, split creates a list of the three names. The for loop iterates through the names and creates a string from the first characters.'''
