'''Write a function which is given an exam mark, and it returns a string â€” the grade for that mark â€” according to this scheme:
Mark 	Grade
>= 90 	A
[80-90) 	B
[70-80) 	C
[60-70) 	D
< 60 	F

The square and round brackets denote closed and open intervals.
 A closed interval includes the number, and open interval excludes it. So 79.99999 gets grade C , but 80 gets grade B.

Test your function by printing the mark and the grade for a number of different marks.
