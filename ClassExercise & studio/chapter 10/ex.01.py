'''

Draw a reference diagram for a and b before and after the third line of the following python code is executed:

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a[:]
b[0] = 5

'''



Your diagram should show two variables referring to two different lists.
a refers to the original list with 1,2, and 3.
b refers to a list with 5,2, and 3 since the zero-eth element was replaced with 5.
